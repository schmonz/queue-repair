=============================

Please report bugs to the author at <pqt @ discworld.dyndns.org>

Version 0.9.0
22 October 2003

  -many cleanups to the code
  -mode of todo files was wrong in some cases when ext-todo was
   in use or big-todo not in use; thanks to Thomas Palmieri and David Gartner
   for their reports that helped me track this down.

Version 0.8.6
14 April 2002

  -cleanups, better reporting of what queue_repair is doing.

Version 0.8.5
13 December 2001

  -minor changes in reporting of ownership of files and directories
  
Version 0.8.4
8 July 2001

  -when force-creating a queue, ensure the user supplies a value for conf-split
  and either --bigtodo or --no-bigtodo
  -change --create to imply --repair as well

Version 0.8.3
7 July 2001

  -enforce checking of prime conf-split.  Use --i-want-a-broken-conf-split to
    force a non-prime split value in repair mode
  -add explicit -h, --help options
  -enforce checking of existence of basic queue directories to prevent 
    accidental creation of queue in wrong place due to typos, etc.  Use
    -c, --create to force creation of a new queue
  -when creating a directory, force create missing parent(s)
  -fix --no-bigtodo to allow conversion of big-todo queue to non-big-todo;
    would previously auto-detect big-todo regardless
  -improve forced conversion of non-big-todo queue to big-todo or vice versa,
    and force change of conf-split for existing queues

Version 0.8.2
6 July 2001

  -fix intd split issues without big-todo.  Thanks to Lou Hevly for the report.
  -remove unused user and group from dictionary
  -whitespace cleanups
